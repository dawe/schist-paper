abstract = {{scRNA}-seq profiles each represent a highly partial sample of {mRNA} molecules from a unique cell that can never be resampled, and robust analysis must separate the sampling effect from biological variance. We describe a methodology for partitioning {scRNA}-seq datasets into metacells: disjoint and homogenous groups of profiles that could have been resampled from the same cell. Unlike clustering analysis, our algorithm specializes at obtaining granular as opposed to maximal groups. We show how to use metacells as building blocks for complex quantitative transcriptional maps while avoiding data smoothing. Our algorithms are implemented in the {MetaCell} R/C++ software package.}

However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating {scRNA}-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align {scRNA}-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of {scRNA}-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.}

This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14 clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods developed explicitly for {scRNA}-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly available {scRNA}-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with {SC3} and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering. All the code used for the evaluation is available on {GitHub} ( https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/{scRNAseq\_clustering\_comparison}). In addition, an R package providing access to data and clustering results, thereby facilitating inclusion of new methods and data sets, is available from Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/{DuoClustering2018}).}

abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.}

New methods that enable simple yet high-throughput single-cell expression profiling are highly desirable. {RESULTS}: Here we report a novel nanowell-based single-cell {RNA} sequencing system, {ICELL8}, which enables processing of thousands of cells per sample. The system employs a 5,184-nanowell-containing microchip to capture \~1,300 single cells and process them. Each nanowell contains preprinted oligonucleotides encoding poly-d(T), a unique well barcode, and a unique molecular identifier. The {ICELL8} system uses imaging software to identify nanowells containing viable single cells and only wells with single cells are processed into sequencing libraries. Here, we report the performance and utility of {ICELL8} using samples of increasing complexity from cultured cells to mouse solid tissue samples. Our assessment of the system to discriminate between mixed human and mouse cells showed that {ICELL8} has a low cell multiplet rate (\textless 3\%) and low cross-cell contamination. We characterized single-cell transcriptomes of more than a thousand cultured human and mouse cells as well as 468 mouse pancreatic islets cells. We were able to identify distinct cell types in pancreatic islets, including alpha, beta, delta and gamma cells. {CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, {ICELL8} provides efficient and cost-effective single-cell expression profiling of thousands of cells, allowing researchers to decipher single-cell transcriptomes within complex biological samples.}

We found five niche/somatic cell types (Leydig, myoid, Sertoli, endothelial, macrophage), and observed germline-niche interactions and key human-mouse differences. Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early {\SSC} state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants, and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant {\SSCs}. Overall, our datasets describe key transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of the normal adult human testis, and provide new insights into germ cell developmental transitions and plasticity.}

Due to its importance, novel methods have been developed recently for this purpose. However, different approaches generate varying estimates regarding the number of clusters and the single-cell level cluster assignments. This type of unsupervised clustering is challenging and it is often times hard to gauge which method to use because none of the existing methods outperform others across all scenarios. We present {SAME}-clustering, a mixture model-based approach that takes clustering solutions from multiple methods and selects a maximally diverse subset to produce an improved ensemble solution. We tested {SAME}-clustering across 15 {scRNA}-seq datasets generated by different platforms, with number of clusters varying from 3 to 15, and number of single cells from 49 to 32 695. Results show that our {SAME}-clustering ensemble method yields enhanced clustering, in terms of both cluster assignments and number of clusters. The mixture model ensemble clustering is not limited to clustering {scRNA}-seq data and may be useful to a wide range of clustering applications. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell {RNA}-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.}

However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed {dscRNA}-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of \textgreater99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon ({IFN})-\beta and perform {eQTL} analysis on 23 pooled samples.}

Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks.

abstract = {Single-cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNAseq}) is a powerful tool to study heterogeneity of cells. Recently, several clustering based methods have been proposed to identify distinct cell populations. These methods are based on different statistical models and usually require to perform several additional steps, such as preprocessing or dimension reduction, before applying the clustering algorithm. Individual steps are often controlled by method-specific parameters, permitting the method to be used in different modes on the same datasets, depending on the user choices. The large number of possibilities that these methods provide can intimidate non-expert users, since the available choices are not always clearly documented. In addition, to date, no large studies have invistigated the role and the impact that these choices can have in different experimental contexts. This work aims to provide new insights into the advantages and drawbacks of {scRNAseq} clustering methods and describe the ranges of possibilities that are offered to users. In particular, we provide an extensive evaluation of several methods with respect to different modes of usage and parameter settings by applying them to real and simulated datasets that vary in terms of dimensionality, number of cell populations or levels of noise. Remarkably, the results presented here show that great variability in the performance of the models is strongly attributed to the choice of the user-specific parameter settings. We describe several tendencies in the performance attributed to their modes of usage and different types of datasets, and identify which methods are strongly affected by data dimensionality in terms of computational time. Finally, we highlight some open challenges in {scRNAseq} data clustering, such as those related to the identification of the number of clusters.

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed {PhenoGraph}, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. {PhenoGraph} revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into {AML} pathophysiology.

abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) can characterize cell types and states through unsupervised clustering, but the ever increasing number of cells and batch effect impose computational challenges. We present {DESC}, an unsupervised deep embedding algorithm that clusters {scRNA}-seq data by iteratively optimizing a clustering objective function. Through iterative self-learning, {DESC} gradually removes batch effects, as long as technical differences across batches are smaller than true biological variations. As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from {DESC} are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells. Comprehensive evaluations show that {DESC} offers a proper balance of clustering accuracy and stability, has a small footprint on memory, does not explicitly require batch information for batch effect removal, and can utilize {GPU} when available. As the scale of single-cell studies continues to grow, we believe {DESC} will offer a valuable tool for biomedical researchers to disentangle complex cellular heterogeneity.}

Here, we introduce {CIDR} (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm that uses a novel yet very simple implicit imputation approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in {scRNA}-seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we show that {CIDR} improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-{SNE}, {ZIFA}, and {RaceID}, in terms of clustering accuracy. {CIDR} typically completes within seconds when processing a data set of hundreds of cells and minutes for a data set of thousands of cells. {CIDR} can be downloaded at https://github.com/{VCCRI}/{CIDR} .}

The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their {RNA} capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used {scRNA}-seq and single-nucleus {RNA}-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.}

We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the {CDK4}, {EGFR}, and {PDGFRA} loci and by mutations in the {NF1} locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.}

We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, we reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity in diverse regulatory programs central to glioblastoma biology, prognosis, and therapy.

Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

We show that the heuristic is capable of delivering results which are indistinguishable from the more exact and numerically expensive {MCMC} method in many artificial and empirical networks, despite being much faster. The method is entirely unbiased towards any specific mixing pattern, and in particular it does not favor assortative community structures.}

When the desired structure is composed of modules or "communities," a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model ({SBM}), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the {SBM}, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e., the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: (1) deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, which not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks but also reveal structures at multiple scales; (2) a very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical {SBM}.}

We also obtain that the maximum number of detectable blocks scales as sqrt[N], where N is the number of nodes in the network, for a fixed average degree ⟨k⟩. We also show that the simplicity of the minimum description length approach yields an efficient multilevel Monte Carlo inference algorithm with a complexity of O({\tauNlogN}), if the number of blocks is unknown, and O({\tauN}) if it is known, where \tau is the mixing time of the Markov chain.

However most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as the resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs for the very popular approach of modularity optimization, but also for more principled ones based on statistical inference and model selection. Here we construct a nested generative model which, through a complete description of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation, and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible by current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm which scales well for very large networks.}

Our approach applies to weighted and directed networks alike. It contains the ad hoc introduced quality function from [J. Reichardt and S. Bornholdt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 218701 (2004)] and the modularity Q as defined by Newman and Girvan [Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004)] as special cases. The community structure of the network is interpreted as the spin configuration that minimizes the energy of the spin glass with the spin states being the community indices. We elucidate the properties of the ground state configuration to give a concise definition of communities as cohesive subgroups in networks that is adaptive to the specific class of network under study. Further, we show how hierarchies and overlap in the community structure can be detected. Computationally efficient local update rules for optimization procedures to find the ground state are given. We show how the ansatz may be used to discover the community around a given node without detecting all communities in the full network and we give benchmarks for the performance of this extension. Finally, we give expectation values for the modularity of random graphs, which can be used in the assessment of statistical significance of community structure.}

We used {SPLiT}-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. {SPLiT}-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.

The Human Tumor Atlas Network ({HTAN}), part of the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) Cancer Moonshot Initiative, will establish a clinical, experimental, computational, and organizational framework to generate informative and accessible three-dimensional atlases of cancer transitions for a diverse set of tumor types. This effort complements both ongoing efforts to map healthy organs and previous large-scale cancer genomics approaches focused on bulk sequencing at a single point in time. Generating single-cell, multiparametric, longitudinal atlases and integrating them with clinical outcomes should help identify novel predictive biomarkers and features as well as therapeutically relevant cell types, cell states, and cellular interactions across transitions. The resulting tumor atlases should have a profound impact on our understanding of cancer biology and have the potential to improve cancer detection, prevention, and therapeutic discovery for better precision-medicine treatments of cancer patients and those at risk for cancer.

In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the {MITF} transcription factor also contained cells with low {MITF} and elevated levels of the {AXL} kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions.

abstract = {Detecting communities in large networks has drawn much attention over the years. While modularity remains one of the more popular methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by "resolution-limit-free," that is, not suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous definition and derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection methods are resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods. Finally, we provide such a natural formulation, and show it performs superbly.}

abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.}

Trophoblast-decidual interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand-receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell-cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal-fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success.}

In particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular composition as well as functional variation in homogenic cell populations. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell types based on gene expression patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes). {RESULTS}: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named shared nearest neighbor ({SNN})-Cliq that clusters single-cell transcriptomes. {SNN}-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental datasets, {SNN}-Cliq outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More importantly, the clustering results of {SNN}-Cliq reflect the cell types or origins with high accuracy. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The algorithm is implemented in {MATLAB} and Python.

Current methods, either performing hypothesis tests at an arbitrary resolution or testing hypotheses at all possible resolutions leading to nested results, are suboptimal. Moreover, they are not flexible enough to work in situations where each entity has multiple features to consider and different resolutions might be required for different features. For example, in single cell {RNA}-seq data, an increasing focus is to find differential state genes that change expression within a cell subpopulation in response to an external stimulus. Such differential expression might occur at different resolutions (e.g., all cells or a small set of cells) for different genes. Our new algorithm {treeclimbR} is designed to fill this gap by exploiting a hierarchical tree of entities, proposing multiple candidates that capture the latent signal and pinpointing branches or leaves that contain features of interest, in a data-driven way. It outperforms currently available methods on synthetic data, and we highlight the approach on various applications, including microbiome and {microRNA} surveys as well as single cell cytometry and {RNA}-seq datasets. With the emergence of various multi-resolution genomic datasets, {treeclimbR} provides a thorough inspection on entities across resolutions and gives additional flexibility to uncover biological associations.}
